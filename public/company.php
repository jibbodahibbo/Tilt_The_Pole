        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <hr>
            <p>Tilt the Pole was created because there is no real effective way to create shade with contract umbrellas (contract umbrellas are umbrellas used in the hospitality/resort industry that do not tilt). This means that you have to continually move to capture any shade. Tilting and rotating the umbrella pole in the direction of the sun allows the user to create shade all day long. The first ideas were to create an “automatic sun tracking version” using complex counter-balancing techniques, solar panels, and motors to create shade. These patented ideas are still available for discussion (please send us an email), but the simplest/most cost effective method to tilt and rotate is evident in the current TTP product.</p>
        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Tilt the Pole maximizes shade by tilting the umbrella pole.  This patented product can be used with any 1.5” umbrella and can be scaled (up or down) to meet our customer’s needs. The interested customers will include umbrella manufacturers and outdoor furniture manufacturers. The industries requiring the robustness / durability of the TTP include: resort/hospitality; beach umbrellas; lifeguard stands; outdoor seating; fast food restaurants.  By tilting the pole, the end user will have maximum shade that is safe and secure. The end user appreciates the fact that “tilt the pole” gains them shade.  The product must be easy to use and safe. The TTP (tilt the pole solution) will be used with new umbrellas/installations but can also be used with existing umbrellas (ask for details).</p>
